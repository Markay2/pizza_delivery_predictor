### Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly form to input delivery parameters
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant delivery time estimates using trained ML model
- **Comprehensive Inputs**: Considers 16 different factors affecting delivery time
- **Smart Encoding**: Handles categorical variables with proper label encoding
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **LightGBM**: Machine learning model for predictions
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities
- **Joblib**: Model serialization

### Model Features

The model uses the following features to predict delivery time:

1. **Pizza Details**: Size, Type, Toppings Count, Complexity
2. **Location**: Distance (km), Traffic Level, Traffic Impact
3. **Timing**: Order Hour, Order Month, Order Day, Peak Hour, Weekend
4. **Payment**: Payment Method, Payment Category
5. **Restaurant**: Restaurant Average Time
6. **Derived**: Topping Density

### How to Use

1. Fill out the form with your pizza order details
2. Click "Predict Delivery Time" to get an estimate
3. View the estimated delivery time in minutes
4. Get additional insights about delivery speed
